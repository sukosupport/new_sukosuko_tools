    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy sets out how "SHOWROOM New Sukosuko Tools" (hereinafter referred to as "our App") handles information related to the privacy and personal information of users in the services it provides.</p>

        <li>Usage status and log information (reports from app store operators such as Google and Apple)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that our App does not manage or collect any account-related information (login IDs, passwords, user information, etc.) or personal information. User authentication is performed through SHOWROOM's official API.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>Our App will not share or disclose user information to third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When disclosure is required by legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Since our App does not manage any account information or personally identifiable information other than communication through SHOWROOM's official API, the rights users can exercise against our App are primarily as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access to Information</strong>: As our App does not directly collect personal information from users, the right to access depends on SHOWROOM's official services. Users can request access to their information in accordance with SHOWROOM's privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion of Information</strong>: Information stored by our App does not identify individuals. Uninstalling our App will stop the collection of information by our App.</li>
        <li><strong>Objections</strong>: If users have concerns about the functions of our App or the information collected, they can provide feedback at any time. Feedback should be sent to <a href="mailto:suko.assist@gmail.com">suko.assist@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>Our App uses cookies for the purposes of managing users' login states and streamlining communication with SHOWROOM's official API. These cookies temporarily store information on users' devices to maintain login states and facilitate smooth API communication when accessing SHOWROOM services.</p>

    <h2>6. About Advertising</h2>
    <p>Our App uses Google AdMob and other third-party advertising services to display ads to users. These services may use the user's advertising ID for the purpose of displaying ads, measuring the effectiveness of ad campaigns, and providing targeted ads.</p>
    <p>Advertising IDs are used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide users with more relevant ads</li>
        <li>To measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns</li>
        <li>To prevent fraudulent ad displays</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users can reset their advertising ID or disable personalized ads through their device settings. However, disabling personalized ads will not reduce the number of ads shown, but will result in less relevant ads.</p>

    <h2>7. Protective Measures</h2>
    <p>Our App takes appropriate physical, technical, and administrative security measures to protect the safety of user information.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Our App may update this Privacy Policy as necessary. The updated privacy policy will take effect upon its publication on our App or related official websites.</p>

    <p>Last Updated: March 30, 2024</p>
